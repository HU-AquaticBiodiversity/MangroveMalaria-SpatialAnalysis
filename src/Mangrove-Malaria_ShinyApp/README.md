# Mangrove-Malaria ShinyApp

This ShinyApp helps to illustrate the effect of spatial resolution on the Mangrove-Malaria relationship.

Each path diagram represents a piecewise structural equation model (SEM) whose spatial resolution r corresponds to the radius surrounding the malaria sruvey site, for which the mangrove variables (land cover and NDVI) were calculated.

## How to run the ShinyApp?
<b>Step 1</b> - Download the folder or clone the GitHub repo.

<b>Step 2</b> - Type the following code in R
```
library(shiny)
runApp("add directory of ShinyApp folder here")
```
